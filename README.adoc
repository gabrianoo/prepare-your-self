= Prepare your self for software engineering concepts and technologies

== Build Status

== Use Case

. User profile
[TIP]
Almost no application now don't have a user profile so we picked it as our first use case. User can create profile that consists of simple user information and his profile picture.

== Technologies

. JUnit
. Hamcrest
. Mockito
. JBehave

== Principals

. TDD
. SOLID
[TIP]
Single Responsibility Principal states that every class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class. All its services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.
[TIP]
Open/Closed Principal states "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification"; such an entity can allow its behavior to be extended without modifying its existing functionality/source code.
[TIP]
Liskov Substitution Principal in a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S (i.e., objects of type S may substitute objects of type T).
[TIP]
Interface Segregation Principal states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
[TIP]
Dependency Inversion High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
. KISS
[TIP]
Keep It Stupid Simple
. YAGNI
[TIP]
You Ant Gonna Need It
. Aggregation
[TIP]
A "uses" B = Aggregation : B exists independently (conceptually) from A
. Composition
[TIP]
A "owns" B = Composition : B has no meaning or purpose in the system without A
. Package By Feature
[TIP]
Package-by-feature uses packages to reflect the feature set. It places all items related to a single feature (and only that feature) into a single directory/package. This results in packages with high cohesion and high modularity, and with minimal coupling between packages. Items that work closely together are placed next to each other.

== Steps

. Created the project link:pom.xml[] file
[source,xml]
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
           xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
           http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
      <groupId>com.learn</groupId>
      <artifactId>prepare-your-self</artifactId>
      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </project>

. Created the needed folder for our project link:src/main/java/com/learn[] and link:src/test/java/com/learn[]

. Designed the class diagram of our use case

  image:src/main/resources/pic/MediaServiceClassDiagram.png[]
  image:src/main/resources/pic/UserServiceClassDiagram.png[]
  image:src/main/resources/pic/ProfileManagementClassDiagram.png[]

. Added the Junit dependency to the maven pom file.
[source,xml]
  <dependency>
      <groupId>junit</groupId>
      <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
      <version>4.12</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
  </dependency>

. Added the Mockito dependency to the maven pom file.
[source,xml]
  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
      <artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>
      <version>1.10.19</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
  </dependency>

. Added Google Guava dependency to the maven pom file.
[source,xml]
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.google.guava</groupId>
        <artifactId>guava</artifactId>
        <version>18.0</version>
    </dependency>
