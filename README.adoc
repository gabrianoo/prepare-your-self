= Prepare your self for software engineering concepts and technologies

== Use Case

. User profile

Almost no application now don't have a user profile so we picked it as our first use case.

== Technologies

. JUnit
. Hamcrest
. Mockito
. JBehave

== Principals

. TDD
. SOLID
. KISS
. YAGNI
. Package By Feature

Package-by-feature uses packages to reflect the feature set. It places all items related to a single feature (and only that feature) into a single directory/package. This results in packages with high cohesion and high modularity, and with minimal coupling between packages. Items that work closely together are placed next to each other.
